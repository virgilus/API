    "# Deploy an API Docker Image to Docker Hub and Azure Container Apps\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the meaning of deploying?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying an application means making it available for use by users. In the context of web applications or APIs, deployment typically involves packaging the application code, dependencies, and configurations into a format that can be run on a server or cloud platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays a good practice is to containerize the application using Docker. We're going to build the application, push it to a container registry (like Docker Hub), and then deploy it to a hosting environment (like Azure Container Apps) where it can be accessed over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Azure function vs Azure Container Apps vs Azure App Service\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Azure Functions**: Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that allows you to run small pieces of code (functions) without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's event-driven, meaning functions are triggered by specific events (like HTTP requests, timers, or messages from other services). Azure Functions is ideal for lightweight, short-lived tasks and microservices.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's the cheapest option among the three, but it has limitations in terms of execution time and resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Azure App Service**: Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps and APIs. It supports multiple programming languages and frameworks, and it provides features like custom domains, SSL certificates, and auto-scaling. Azure App Service is suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple web apps to complex enterprise applications. It offers more control over the application environment compared to Azure Functions and Azure Container Apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Azure Container Apps**: Azure Container Apps is a fully managed serverless container service that allows you to run containerized applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. It supports microservices architectures and can scale based on demand. Azure Container Apps is suitable for applications that require more control over the runtime environment and dependencies compared to Azure Functions. It offers more flexibility and is a good choice for applications that need to run continuously or have complex dependencies.\n",

    "## Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's make and deploy an API from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the repo github.com/virgilus/frost-app-basic\n",
    "1. Clone the repo\n",
    "2. Create an API using FastAPI, named the file \"main.py\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    At minimum, the API must have a root endpoint (\"/\") that returns a welcome message.\n",
    "    As well as a \"/frost-days\" endpoint that accepts the following input parameters:\n",
    "    - \"name\": str (city name)\n",
    "    - (optional) \"start_year\": str (start year in \"YYYY\" format)\n",
    "    - (optional) \"end_year\": str (end year in \"YYYY\" format)\n",
    "  Years must be between 2014 and 2023. (These are the default parameters.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Build the Docker image\n",
    "4. Push the Docker image to Docker Hub\n",
    "5. Deploy the Docker image to Azure Container Apps\n",
    "6. Do it a second time using only the Azure CLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process to Azure Container Apps whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.\n",
    "2. Run several containers using Azure Container Apps that communicate together.\n",
    "3. Use App Insights to monitor the API performance and usage statistics.\n",
    "4. Store the logs in a blob storage folder."

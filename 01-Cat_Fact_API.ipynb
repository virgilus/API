    "# API : Example with Cat Fact Ninja\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an API ?\n",
    "\n",
    "API stands for \"Application Programming Interface\". It's a way for different software to communicate with each other, as opposed to a \"user interface\" which is a way for humans to communicate with a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## API REST\n",
    "\n",
    "A **REST API** (REST = \"Representational state transfer\") is a widespread type of API used when software communicates through the internet as client and server. REST APIs usually share the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "### An API URL\n",
    "\n",
    "An API URL Path is an address that allows you to access an API and its various features. It looks like a basic website URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex: ``https://catfact.ninja/``\n",
    "\n",
    "### Endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "The endpoint is the URL which gives access to a resource of a REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex : ``/fact``\n",
    "\n",
    "This endpoint allows us to use the resource \"fact\" which returns a random fact about cats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods / Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Each resource understands one or several methods, also called actions. The four main methods are :\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The **GET** request is used to read/retrieve data from the API, it is also the most common method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **POST** request is used to send data (file, form data, etc.) to the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **PUT** request is used to create or modify data on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **DELETE** request is used to delete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a browser (chrome, firefox) and the HTTP protocol, **GET** is the default method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Response\n",
    "\n",
    "When an API receives a query, it sends back a response. The response indicates if the query has been successful and may also contain data in return. Usually the response is in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format which shares the same syntax as a Python dictionary.\n",
    "If we launch a browser to go to this address : https://catfact.ninja/fact, this message can be returned (or another one, because there are many random messages):\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"fact\":\"Owning a cat is actually proven to be beneficial for your health.\",\"length\":65}\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "After specifying the endpoint, users can give parameters to the API. It starts with a \"?\" and then takes the name of the argument, the equal symbol \"=\" and the value of the argument. In this example we can limit the length of the random cat fact using the parameter ``max_length``: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://catfact.ninja/fact?max_length=48\n",
    "\n",
    "If you press F5 to refresh your browser, you can see that no answer contains more than 48 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to pass several arguments, we use \"&\" as a separator.\n",
    "### Payload\n",
    "\n",
    "Payload is the data a user sends or receives.\n",
    "In the last example the query parameters are : ``max_length=48``. The parameter is ``max_length`` and the payload is ``48``.\n",
    "In the response we got earlier which was :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\"fact\":\"Owning a cat is actually proven to be beneficial for your health.\", \"length\":65}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The payload is \"Owning a cat is actually proven to be beneficial for your health.\" and \"65\". The rest is referred to as *overhead data*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercice\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the API documentation here: https://catfact.ninja/docs/ and send a request to the endpoint ``/facts`` (plural) using the two possible parameters using your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The library ``requests`` allows the user to use the HTTP protocol with Python, thus making it an efficient way to use APIs."
